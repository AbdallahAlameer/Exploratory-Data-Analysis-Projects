# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques using Python.  
The focus is on understanding the dataset, engineering useful features, and visualizing insights.

---

## 🔎 Main Steps
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Imported dataset using Pandas.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted new features such as `HOUR OCC` (hour of occurrence) from time columns.

3. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted distributions and countplots with Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
   - Identified peak hours and areas with higher occurrence.

4. **Insights**  
   - Crimes are more frequent at certain hours.  
   - Night-time patterns show specific hotspots.
