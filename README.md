# Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering Projects



## Overview
This repository collects hands-on projects for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering performed using Python (Jupyter Notebooks). 
Each folder contains a single practical exercise (data cleaning, visualization, feature creation, modeling prep) with:
- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Required small sample datasets (or links to download)
- Notes about decisions, assumptions
